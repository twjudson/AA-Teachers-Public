        <title>Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals</title>
    
        <p> In the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the group. Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in the ring. More specifically, if <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are rings, then a <term>ring homomorphism</term>
        <idx><h>Homomorphism</h><h>ring</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Ring</h><h>homomorphism</h></idx>
        is a map <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> satisfying
            <md>
                <mrow>\phi( a + b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) + \phi(b)</mrow>
                <mrow>\phi( a b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) \phi(b)</mrow>
            </md>
        for all <m>a, b \in R</m>. If <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism, then <m>\phi</m> is called an <term>isomorphism</term>
        <idx><h>Isomorphism</h><h>ring</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Ring</h><h>isomorphism</h></idx>
        of rings.</p>

        <p>The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to <m>0</m> plays a fundamental role in the theory of rings. For any ring homomorphism <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m>, we define the <term>kernel</term><idx><h>Homomorphism</h><h>kernel of a ring</h></idx><idx><h>Kernel</h><h>of a ring homomorphism</h></idx> of a ring homomorphism to be the set
            <me>\ker \phi = \{ r \in R : \phi( r ) = 0 \}.</me></p>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-homo">
            <p>For any integer <m>n</m> we can define a ring homomorphism <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <m>a \mapsto a \pmod{n}</m>. This is indeed a ring homomorphism, since
                <md>
                    <mrow>\phi( a + b ) &amp; = (a + b) \pmod{n}</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = a \pmod{n} + b \pmod{n}</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = \phi( a ) + \phi(b)</mrow>
                </md>
            and
                <md>
                    <mrow>\phi( a b ) &amp; = ab \pmod{n}</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = a \pmod{n}\cdot b \pmod{n}</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = \phi( a ) \phi(b).</mrow>
                </md>
            The kernel of the homomorphism <m>\phi</m> is <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-continuous-function-homomorph">
            <p>Let <m>C[a, b]</m> be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> as in <xref ref="example-ideals-functions"/>. For a fixed  <m>\alpha \in [a, b]</m>, we can define a ring homomorphism <m>\phi_{\alpha} : C[a, b] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}</m> by <m>\phi_{\alpha} (f ) = f( \alpha)</m>. This  is a ring homomorphism since
                <md>
                    <mrow>\phi_{\alpha}( f + g ) = (f + g)( \alpha) = f(\alpha) + g(\alpha) = \phi_{\alpha}( f ) + \phi_{\alpha}(g )</mrow>

        <p>In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role. These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups. In ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings called ideals. An <term>ideal</term><idx><h>Ideal</h><h>definition of</h></idx> in a ring <m>R</m> is a subring <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> such that if <m>a</m> is in <m>I</m> and <m>r</m> is in <m>R</m>, then both <m>ar</m> and <m>ra</m> are in <m>I</m>; that is, <m>rI \subset I</m> and <m>Ir \subset I</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-trivial-ideal">
            <p>Every ring <m>R</m> has at least two ideals, <m>\{ 0 \}</m> and <m>R</m>. These ideals are called the <term>trivial ideals</term>.

        <p>Let <m>R</m> be a ring with identity and suppose that <m>I</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m> such that <m>1</m> is in <m>I</m>. Since for any <m>r \in R</m>, <m>r1 = r \in I</m> by the definition of an ideal, <m>I = R</m>.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-principal-ideal">
            <p>If <m>a</m> is any element in a commutative ring <m>R</m> with identity, then the set
                <me>\langle a \rangle = \{ ar : r \in R \}</me>
            is an ideal in <m>R</m>. Certainly, <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is nonempty since both <m>0 = a0</m> and <m>a = a1</m> are in <m>\langle a \rangle</m>. The sum of two elements in <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is again in <m>\langle a \rangle</m> since <m>ar + ar' = a(r + r')</m>. The inverse of <m>ar</m> is <m>-ar = a (-r) \in \langle a \rangle</m>. Finally, if we multiply an element <m>ar \in \langle a \rangle</m> by an arbitrary element <m>s \in R</m>, we have <m>s(ar) = a(sr)</m>. Therefore, <m>\langle a \rangle</m> satisfies the definition of an ideal.</p>
        </example>

            <p>If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring with identity, then an ideal of the form <m>\langle a \rangle = \{ ar : r \in R \}</m> is called a <term>principal ideal</term>.

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-z-ideals">
            <statement>
                <p>Every ideal in the ring of integers <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a principal ideal.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>The zero ideal <m>\{ 0 \}</m> is a principal ideal since <m>\langle 0 \rangle = \{ 0 \}</m>. If  <m>I</m> is any nonzero ideal in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>, then  <m>I</m> must contain some positive integer <m>m</m>. There exists a least positive integer <m>n</m> in <m>I</m> by the Principle of Well-Ordering. Now let <m>a</m> be any element in <m>I</m>. Using the division algorithm, we know that there exist integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
                    <me>a = nq + r</me>
                where <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m>.This equation tells us that <m>r = a - nq \in I</m>, but <m>r</m> must be <m>0</m> since <m>n</m> is the least positive element in <m>I</m>. Therefore, <m>a = nq</m> and <m>I = \langle n \rangle</m>.</p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-integer-ideal">
            <p>The set <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> is ideal in the ring of integers. If <m>na</m> is in <m>n{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>b</m> is in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>, then <m>nab</m> is in <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> as required. In fact, by <xref ref="theorem-z-ideals"/>, these are the only ideals of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.</p>

        <proposition>
            <statement>
                <p>The kernel of any ring homomorphism<m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
        We know from group theory that
        <m>\ker \phi</m> is an additive subgroup of <m>R</m>. Suppose that <m>r \in R</m> and <m>a \in \ker \phi</m>. Then we must show that <m>ar</m> and <m>ra</m> are in <m>\ker \phi</m>. However,
                    <me>\phi(ar) = \phi(a) \phi(r) = 0 \phi(r) = 0</me>
                and
                    <me>\phi(ra) = \phi(r) \phi(a) =  \phi(r)0 = 0.</me></p>
            </proof>
        </proposition>

        <remark>
            <p>In our definition of an ideal we have required that <m>rI \subset I</m> and <m>Ir \subset I</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>. Such ideals are sometimes referred to as <term>two-sided ideals</term>.
            <idx><h>Ideal</h><h>two-sided</h></idx>
            We can also consider <term>one-sided ideals</term>;
            <idx><h>Ideal</h><h>one-sided</h></idx>
            that is, we may require only that either <m>rI \subset I</m> or <m>Ir \subset I</m> for <m>r \in R</m> hold but not both. Such ideals are called <term>left ideals</term> and <term>right ideals</term>, respectively. Of course, in a commutative ring any ideal must be two-sided. In this text we will concentrate on two-sided ideals.</p>

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-factor-ring">
            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>I</m> be an ideal of <m>R</m>. The factor group <m>R/I</m> is a ring with multiplication defined by
                    <me>(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I.</me></p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>We already know that <m>R/I</m> is an abelian group under addition. Let <m>r+I</m> and <m>s +I</m> be in <m>R/I</m>. We must show that the product <m>(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I</m> is independent of the choice of coset; that is, if <m>r' \in r+I</m> and <m>s' \in s+I</m>, then <m>r's'</m> must be in <m>rs+I</m>. Since <m>r' \in r+I</m>, there exists an element <m>a</m>  in <m>I</m> such that <m>r' = r + a</m>. Similarly, there exists a <m>b \in I</m> such that <m>s' = s + b</m>. Notice that
                    <me>r' s' = (r+a)(s+b) = rs + as + rb + ab</me>
                and <m>as + rb + ab \in I</m> since <m>I</m> is an ideal; consequently, <m>r' s' \in rs + I</m>. We will leave as an exercise the verification of the  associative law for multiplication and the distributive laws.</p>

            <proof>
                <p>Certainly <m>\phi : R \rightarrow R/I</m> is a surjective abelian group homomorphism. It remains to show that <m>\phi</m> works correctly under ring multiplication. Let <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> be in <m>R</m>. Then
                    <me>\phi(r) \phi(s) = (r + I)(s+I) = rs + I = \phi(rs),</me>
                which completes the proof of the theorem.</p>

        In ring theory we have isomorphism theorems relating ideals and ring homomorphisms similar to the isomorphism theorems for groups that relate normal subgroups and homomorphisms in <xref ref="homomorph"/>.

        <p>In this particular section we are especially interested in certain ideals of commutative rings. These ideals give us special types of factor rings.

Clearly, <m>1 + M</m> acts as an identity for <m>R/M</m>. We must also show that every nonzero element in <m>R/M</m> has an inverse. If <m>a + M</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R/M</m>, then <m>a \notin M</m>. Define <m>I</m> to be the set <m>\{ ra + m : r \in R \text{ and } m \in M \}</m>. We will show that <m>I</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>. The set <m>I</m> is nonempty since <m>0a+0=0</m> is in <m>I</m>. If <m>r_1 a + m_1</m> and <m>r_2 a + m_2</m> are two elements in <m>I</m>, then
                    <me>(r_1 a + m_1) - ( r_2 a + m_2) = (r_1 - r_2)a + (m_1 - m_2)</me>
                is in <m>I</m>. Also, for any <m>r \in R</m> it is true that <m>rI \subset I</m>; hence, <m>I</m> is closed under multiplication and satisfies the necessary conditions to be an ideal. Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-subring"/> and the definition of an ideal, <m>I</m> is an ideal properly containing <m>M</m>. Since <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal, <m>I=R</m>; consequently, by the definition of <m>I</m> there must be an <m>m</m> in <m>M</m> and an element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>1=ab+m</m>. Therefore,
                    <me>1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a+M)(b+M).</me></p>

                <p>Conversely, suppose that <m>M</m> is an ideal and <m>R/M</m> is a field. Since <m>R/M</m> is a field, it must contain at least two elements: <m>0 + M = M</m> and <m>1 + M</m>. Hence, <m>M</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>. Let <m>I</m> be any ideal properly containing <m>M</m>. We need to show that <m>I = R</m>. Choose <m>a</m> in <m>I</m> but not in <m>M</m>. Since <m>a+ M</m> is a nonzero element in a field, there exists an element <m>b +M</m> in <m>R/M</m> such that <m>(a+M)(b+M) = ab + M = 1+M</m>. Consequently, there exists an element <m>m \in M</m> such that <m>ab + m = 1</m> and <m>1</m> is in <m>I</m>. Therefore, <m>r1 =r \in I</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>. Consequently, <m>I = R</m>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity <m>1</m>, where <m>1 \neq 0</m>. Then <m>P</m> is a prime ideal in <m>R</m> if and only if <m>R/P</m> is an integral domain.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>First let us assume that <m>P</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m> and <m>R/P</m> is an integral domain. Suppose that <m>ab \in P</m>. If <m>a + P</m> and <m>b + P</m> are two elements of <m>R/P</m> such that <m>(a + P)(b + P) = 0 + P = P</m>, then either <m>a + P = P</m> or <m>b + P = P</m>. This means that either <m>a</m> is in <m>P</m> or <m>b</m> is in <m>P</m>, which shows that <m>P</m> must be prime.</p>

                <p>Conversely, suppose that <m>P</m> is prime and
                    <me>(a + P)(b + P) = ab + P = 0 + P = P.</me>
                Then <m>ab \in P</m>. If <m>a \notin P</m>, then <m>b</m> must be in <m>P</m> by the definition of a prime ideal; hence, <m>b + P = 0 + P</m> and <m>R/P</m> is an integral domain.</p>
            </proof>
        </proposition>

        <example xml:id="example-ideals-nz-ideal">
            <p>Every ideal in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is of the form <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m>. The factor ring <m>{\mathbb Z} / n{\mathbb Z} \cong {\mathbb Z}_n</m> is an integral domain only when <m>n</m> is prime. It is actually a field.

            <title>Historical Note</title>
            <p>Amalie Emmy Noether,
            <idx><h>Noether, A. Emmy</h></idx>
            one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century, was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882. She was the daughter of Max Noether <idx><h>Noether, Max</h></idx> (1844<ndash/>1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash/>1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education. She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany. Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students. After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she continued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.</p>

            <p>Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916.
            David Hilbert
            <idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
            and Felix Klein
            <idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
            tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen. Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying, <q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q> Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded, <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent. After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q> At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women. After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.</p>

            <p>In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen. Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view. Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl. One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.</p>

            <p>In 1933, Noether, who was Jewish, was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a position at Bryn Mawr College, and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.</p>
