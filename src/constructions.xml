    <title>Geometric Constructions</title>
    <introduction permid="Tof">
      <p permid="vhh">
        In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed.
        These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry;
        that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them.
        The problems can be stated as follows.

        <ol permid="gWl">
          <li permid="CEp">
            <p permid="pUy">
              Given an arbitrary angle,
              can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="iLy">
            <p permid="WbH">
              Given an arbitrary circle,
              can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="OSH">
            <p permid="CiQ">
              Given a cube,
              can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original?
              Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years,
        each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.
        We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist.
        It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.
      </p>

      <p permid="boq">
        First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,
        and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.
        To begin with, <em>a straightedge is not a ruler</em>.
        We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
        It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points.
        The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction.
        Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.
        We can construct a <m>30^\circ</m> angle;
        hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m> angle.
        However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
        Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.

          <p permid="gtI">
            Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be constructible numbers.

            and <m>\alpha / \beta</m> (<m>\beta \neq 0</m>) are also constructible numbers.
            We can assume that both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are positive with <m>\alpha \gt \beta</m>.
            It is quite obvious how to construct
            <m>\alpha + \beta</m> and <m>\alpha - \beta</m>.
            To find a line segment with length <m>\alpha \beta</m>,
            we assume that <m>\beta \gt 1</m> and construct the triangle in <xref ref="figure-multiplication-construction"/> such that triangles
            <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle ADE</m> are similar.
            Since <m>\alpha / 1 = x / \beta</m>,
            the line segment <m>x</m> has length <m>\alpha \beta</m>.
            A similar construction can be made if <m>\beta \lt 1</m>.
            We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct

        The angle <m>\theta</m> can be constructed if and only if <m>\alpha = \cos \theta</m> is constructible.
        Let <m>\theta = 20^{\circ}</m>.
        Then <m>\cos 3 \theta = \cos 60^\circ = 1/2</m>.
        By the triple-angle formula for the cosine,
        <me permid="NNB">
          4 \alpha^3 - 3 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>8 x^3 - 6 x -1</m>.
        This polynomial has no factors in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>,
        and hence is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
        Thus, <m>[{\mathbb Q}( \alpha ) : {\mathbb Q }] = 3</m>.
        Consequently, <m>\alpha</m> cannot be a constructible number.

          Extensions of the field of rational numbers are a central object of study in number theory,
          so with Sage's roots in this discipline,
          it is no surprise that there is extensive support for fields and for extensions of the rationals.
          Sage also contains an implementation of the entire field of algebraic numbers,
          with exact representations.
