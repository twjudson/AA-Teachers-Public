  <title>The Integers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The integers are the building blocks of mathematics.
      In this chapter we will investigate the fundamental properties of the integers,
      including mathematical induction,
      the division algorithm, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

    <title>Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      Suppose we wish to show that
      <me>
        1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
      </me>
      for any natural number <m>n</m>.
      This formula is easily  verified for small numbers such as <m>n = 1</m>,
      <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, or <m>4</m>,
      but it is impossible to verify for all natural numbers on a case-by-case basis.
      To prove the formula true in general,
      a more generic method is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we have verified the equation for the first <m>n</m> cases.
      We will attempt to show that we can generate the formula for the <m>(n + 1)</m>th case from this knowledge.
      The formula is true for <m>n = 1</m> since
      <me>
        1 = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2}
      </me>.
      If we have verified the first <m>n</m> cases, then
      <md>
        <mrow>1 + 2 + \cdots + n + (n + 1) &amp; = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + n + 1</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = \frac{(n + 1)[(n + 1) + 1]}{2}</mrow>
      </md>.
      This is exactly the formula for the <m>(n + 1)</m>th case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method of proof is known as
      <term>mathematical induction</term>.
      Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset <m>S</m> of the positive integers
      <m>{\mathbb N}</m> on a case-by-case basis,
      an impossible task if <m>S</m> is an infinite set,
      we give a specific proof for the smallest integer being considered,
      followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case,
      then it must also hold for the next case in the sequence.
      We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom.

          8 = 2^3 \gt 3 + 4 = 7

        Assume that <m>2^k \gt k + 4</m> for <m>k \geq 3</m>.

      Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions.
      For instance, there are two ways to define <m>n!</m>,
      the factorial of a positive integer <m>n</m>.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>explicit</em> definition:
            <m>n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n - 1) \cdot n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>inductive</em> or <em>recursive</em> definition:
            <m>1! = 1</m> and <m>n! = n(n - 1)!</m> for <m>n \gt 1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Every good mathematician or computer scientist knows that looking at problems recursively,
      as opposed to explicitly,
      often results in better understanding of complex issues.

            Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers, with <m>b \gt 0</m>.
            Then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that

              a = bq + r

            where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.
            We must first prove that the numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> actually exist.
            Then we must show that if <m>q'</m> and <m>r'</m> are two other such numbers,
            then <m>q = q'</m> and <m>r = r'</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Existence of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em> Let
            <me>
              S = \{ a - bk : k \in {\mathbb Z} \text{ and } a - bk \geq 0 \}
            </me>.
            If <m>0 \in S</m>, then <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>,
            and  we can let <m>q = a/b</m> and <m>r = 0</m>.
            If <m>0 \notin S</m>, we can use the Well-Ordering Principle.
            We must first show that <m>S</m> is nonempty.
            If <m>a \gt 0</m>, then <m>a - b \cdot 0 \in S</m>.
            If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S</m>.
            In either case <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.
            By the Well-Ordering Principle,
            <m>S</m> must have a smallest member, say <m>r = a - bq</m>.
            Therefore, <m>a = bq + r</m>, <m>r \geq 0</m>.
            We now show that <m>r \lt b</m>.
            Suppose that <m>r \gt b</m>.
            Then
            <me>
              a - b(q + 1)= a - bq - b = r - b \gt 0
            </me>.
            In this case we would have <m>a - b(q + 1)</m> in the set <m>S</m>.
            But then <m>a - b(q + 1) \lt a - bq</m>,
            which would contradict the fact that
            <m>r = a - bq</m> is the smallest member  of <m>S</m>.
            So <m>r \leq b</m>.
            Since <m>0 \notin S</m>, <m>r \neq b</m> and so <m>r \lt b</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Uniqueness of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em>
            Suppose there exist integers <m>r</m>, <m>r'</m>,
            <m>q</m>, and <m>q'</m> such that
            <me>
              a = bq + r, 0 \leq r \lt b \quad \text{and}\quad a = bq' + r', 0 \leq r' \lt b
            </me>.
            Then <m> bq + r =  bq' + r'</m>.
            Assume that <m>r' \geq r</m>.
            From the last equation we have <m>b(q - q') = r' - r</m>;
            therefore, <m>b</m> must divide <m>r' - r</m> and <m>0 \leq r'- r \leq r' \lt b</m>.
            This is possible only if <m>r' - r = 0</m>.
            Hence, <m>r = r'</m> and  <m>q = q'</m>.

            Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be nonzero integers.
            Then there exist integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that

              \gcd( a, b) = ar + bs

            Furthermore,
            the greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is unique.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let
            <me>
              S = \{ am + bn : m, n \in {\mathbb Z} \text{ and } am + bn \gt 0 \}
            </me>.
            Clearly, the set <m>S</m> is nonempty;
            hence, by the Well-Ordering Principle <m>S</m> must have a smallest member,
            say <m>d = ar + bs</m>.
            We claim that <m>d = \gcd( a, b)</m>.
            Write <m>a = dq + r'</m> where <m>0 \leq r' \lt d</m>.
            If <m>r' \gt 0</m>,
            then <!-- r changed to r' - TWJ 1/31/2011 -->
            <md>
              <mrow>r'&amp; = a - dq</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a - (ar + bs)q</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a - arq - bsq</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a( 1 - rq ) + b( -sq )</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is in <m>S</m>.
            But this would contradict the fact that <m>d</m> is the smallest member of <m>S</m>.
            Hence, <m>r' = 0</m> and <m>d</m> divides <m>a</m>.
            A similar argument shows that <m>d</m> divides <m>b</m>.
            Therefore, <m>d</m> is a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose that <m>d'</m> is another common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
            and we want to show that <m>d' \mid d</m>.
            If we let <m>a = d'h</m> and <m>b = d'k</m>, then
            <me>
              d = ar + bs = d'hr + d'ks = d'(hr + ks)
            </me>.
            So <m>d'</m> must divide <m>d</m>.
            Hence, <m>d</m> must be the unique greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

      <title>The Euclidean Algorithm</title>
      <p>
        Among other things, <xref ref="theorem-integers-gcd"/> allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-integers-gcd">
        <p>
          Let us compute the greatest common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          First observe that
          <md>
            <mrow>2415 &amp; = 945 \cdot 2 + 525</mrow>
            <mrow>945 &amp; = 525 \cdot 1 + 420</mrow>
            <mrow>525 &amp; = 420 \cdot 1 + 105</mrow>
            <mrow>420 &amp; = 105 \cdot 4 + 0</mrow>
          </md>.
          Reversing our steps, <m>105</m> divides <m>420</m>,
          <m>105</m> divides <m>525</m>,
          <m>105</m> divides <m>945</m>,
          and <m>105</m> divides <m>2415</m>.
          Hence, <m>105</m> divides both <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          If <m>d</m> were another common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>,
          then <m>d</m> would also have to divide <m>105</m>.
          Therefore, <m>\gcd( 945, 2415 ) = 105</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we work backward through the above sequence of equations,
          we can also obtain numbers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>945 r + 2415 s = 105</m>.
          Observe that
          <md>
            <mrow>105 &amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot 420</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot [945 + (-1) \cdot 525]</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 525 + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot [2415 + (-2) \cdot 945] + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 2415 + (-5) \cdot 945</mrow>
          </md>.
          So <m>r = -5</m> and <m>s= 2</m>.
          Notice that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are not unique,
          since <m>r = 41</m> and <m>s = -16</m> would also work.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        To compute <m>\gcd(a,b) = d</m>,
        we are using repeated divisions to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers <m>r_1 \gt r_2 \gt \cdots \gt r_n = d</m>; that is,
        <md>
          <mrow>b &amp; = a q_1 + r_1</mrow>
          <mrow>a &amp; = r_1 q_2 + r_2</mrow>
          <mrow>r_1 &amp; = r_2 q_3 + r_3</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \vdots</mrow>
          <mrow>r_{n - 2} &amp; = r_{n - 1} q_{n} + r_{n}</mrow>
          <mrow>r_{n - 1} &amp; = r_n q_{n + 1}</mrow>
        </md>.
        To find <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + bs = d</m>,
        we begin with this last equation and substitute results obtained from the previous equations:
        <md>
          <mrow>d &amp; = r_n</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - r_{n - 1} q_n</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - q_n( r_{n - 3} - q_{n - 1} r_{n - 2} )</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = -q_n r_{n - 3} + ( 1+ q_n q_{n-1} ) r_{n - 2}</mrow>

            We will prove this theorem by contradiction.
            Suppose that there are only a finite number of primes,

            Let <m>P = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1</m>.

            In this case, <m>p_i</m> must divide

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.
        Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
        a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <m>n</m>.
        One problem in number theory is to find a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is prime for each integer <m>n</m>.
        Pierre Fermat (1601?<ndash/>1665) conjectured that
        <m>2^{2^n} + 1</m> was prime for all <m>n</m>,
        but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash/>1783) that
        <me>
          2^{2^5} + 1 = 4{,}294{,}967{,}297
        </me>
        is a composite number.
        One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture.
        In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of <m>2</m> seemed to be the sum of two primes:
        <m>4 = 2 + 2</m>, <m>6 = 3 + 3</m>,
        <m>8 =3 + 5</m>, <m>\ldots</m>.
        Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <m>4 \times 10^{18}</m>,
        it has yet to be proven in general.
        Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography,
        there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.
