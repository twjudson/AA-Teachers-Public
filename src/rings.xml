  <title>Rings</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms,
      but we are often more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations.
      For example,
      one of the most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers with the operations of addition and multiplication.
      These operations are related to one another by the distributive property.
      If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying certain axioms,
      we have an algebraic structure called a ring.
      In a ring we add and multiply elements such as real numbers,
      complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

      A nonempty set <m>R</m> is a <term>ring</term><idx><h>Ring</h><h>definition of</h></idx> if it has two closed binary operations,
      addition and multiplication, satisfying the following conditions.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>a + b = b + a</m> for <m>a, b \in R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(a + b) + c = a + ( b + c)</m> for <m>a, b, c \in R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            There is an element <m>0</m> in <m>R</m> such that
            <m>a + 0 = a</m> for all <m>a \in R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            For every element <m>a \in R</m>,
            there exists an element <m>-a</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a + (-a) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(ab) c = a ( b c)</m> for <m>a, b, c \in R</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            For <m>a, b, c \in R</m>,
            <md>
              <mrow>a( b + c)&amp;= ab +ac</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      This last condition, the distributive axiom,
      relates the binary operations of addition and multiplication.
      Notice that the first four axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition,
      so we could also have defined a ring to be an abelian group <m>(R, +)</m> together with a second binary operation satisfying the fifth and sixth conditions given above.

      If there is an element <m>1 \in R</m> such that <m>1 \neq 0</m> and

    <example xml:id="example-rings-integers">
      <p>
        As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring.
        In fact, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is an integral domain.
        Certainly if <m>a b = 0</m> for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>.
        However, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not a field.
        There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of <m>2</m>,
        since <m>1/2</m> is not an integer.
        The only integers with multiplicative inverses are <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-field">
      <p>
        Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication,
        all of the familiar number systems are rings:
        the rationals, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>;
        the real numbers, <m>{\mathbb R}</m>;
        and the complex numbers, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
        Each of these rings is a field.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-zn">
      <p>
        We can define the product of two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <m>ab \pmod{n}</m>.
        For instance, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        <m>5 \cdot 7 \equiv 11 \pmod{12}</m>.
        This product makes the abelian group <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> into a ring.
        Certainly <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a commutative ring;
        however, it may fail to be an integral domain.
        If we consider <m>3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        it is easy to see that a product of two nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      A nonzero element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> is called a <term>zero divisor</term>
          <idx><h>Zero divisor</h></idx>
      if there is a nonzero element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>ab = 0</m>.
      In the previous example,
      <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are zero divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-functions">
      <p>
        In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> form a commutative ring.
        We add or multiply two functions by adding or multiplying the values of the functions.
        If <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos x</m>,
        then <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 + \cos x</m> and <m>(fg)(x) = f(x) g(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-matrix">
      <p>
        The <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices with entries in
        <m>{\mathbb R}</m> form a ring under the usual operations of matrix addition and multiplication.
        This ring is noncommutative,
        since it is usually the case that <m>AB \neq BA</m>.
        Also, notice that we can have <m>AB = 0</m> when neither <m>A</m> nor <m>B</m> is zero.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-noncommutative">
      <p>
        For an example of a noncommutative division ring, let
        <me>
          1 =

        These elements satisfy the following relations:

          <mrow>{\mathbf i}  {\mathbf k} &amp; =  - {\mathbf j}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Let <m>{\mathbb H}</m> consist of elements of the form <m>a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k}</m>,
        where <m>a, b , c, d</m> are real numbers.
        Equivalently,
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> can be considered to be the set of all <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices of the form

          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>,
        where <m>\alpha = a + di</m> and <m>\beta = b + ci</m> are complex numbers.
        We can define addition and multiplication on
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> either by the usual matrix operations or in terms of the generators <m>1</m>,

        Though multiplication looks complicated,
        it is actually a straightforward computation if we remember that we just add and multiply elements in
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> like polynomials and keep in mind the relationships between the generators <m>{\mathbf i}</m>,
        <m>{\mathbf j}</m>, and <m>{\mathbf k}</m>.
        The ring <m>{\mathbb H}</m> is called the ring of <term>quaternions</term>.

            <!-- TWJ 2/6/2013  -->
      <p>
        To show that the quaternions are a division ring,
        we must be able to find an inverse for each nonzero element.
        Notice that
        <me>
          ( a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} + d {\mathbf k} )( a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} ) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2
        </me>.
        This element can be zero only if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
        <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are all zero.
        So if <m>a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} \neq 0</m>,
        <me>
          (a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} + d {\mathbf k})\left( \frac{a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} }{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2} \right) = 1
        </me>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring with <m>a, b \in R</m>.
          Then

      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove (1), observe that
          <me>
            a0 = a(0+0)= a0+ a0;
          </me>
          hence, <m>a0=0</m>.
          Similarly, <m>0a = 0</m>.
          For (2), we have <m>ab + a(-b) = a(b-b) = a0 = 0</m>;
          consequently, <m>-ab = a(-b)</m>.
          Similarly, <m>-ab = (-a)b</m>.
          Part (3) follows directly from (2) since <m>(-a)(-b) = -(a(- b)) = -(-ab) = ab</m>.

    <p>
      Just as we have subgroups of groups,
      we have an analogous class of substructures for rings.
      A <term>subring</term>
          <idx><h>Subring</h></idx>
      <m>S</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>S</m> is also a ring under the inherited operations from <m>R</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-subring-chain">
      <p>
        The ring <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Notice that even though the original ring may have an identity,
        we do not require that its subring have an identity.
        We have the following chain of subrings:

          {\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Q} \subset {\mathbb R} \subset {\mathbb C}

      Let us briefly recall some definitions.
      If <m>R</m> is a ring and <m>r</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R</m>,
      then <m>r</m> is said to be a <term>zero divisor</term>
      if there is some nonzero element <m>s \in R</m> such that <m>rs = 0</m>.
      A commutative ring with identity is said to be an
      <term>integral domain</term> if it has no zero divisors.
      If an element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> with identity has a multiplicative inverse,
      we say that <m>a</m> is a <term>unit</term>.
      If every nonzero element in a ring <m>R</m> is a unit,
      then <m>R</m> is called a <term>division ring</term>.
      A commutative division ring is called a <term>field</term>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-gaussian-integers">
      <p>
        If <m>i^2 = -1</m>, then the set
        <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ] = \{ m + ni : m, n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> forms a ring known as the
        <term>Gaussian integers</term>.

        <notation>
          <usage>\mathbb Z[i]</usage>
          <description>the Gaussian integers</description>
        </notation>

        It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication.
        Let <m>\alpha = a + bi</m> be a unit in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ]</m>.
        Then <m>\overline{\alpha} = a - bi</m> is also a unit since if <m>\alpha \beta = 1</m>,
        then <m>\overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = 1</m>.
        If <m>\beta = c + di</m>, then
        <me>
          1 = \alpha \beta \overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = (a^2 + b^2 )(c^2 + d^2)
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> must either be <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>;
        or, equivalently, <m>a + bi = \pm 1</m> or <m>a + bi = \pm i</m>.
        Therefore, units of this ring are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm i</m>;
        hence, the Gaussian integers are not a field.
        We will leave it as an exercise to prove that the Gaussian integers are an integral domain.

          Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain.
          Then <m>D</m> has no zero divisors.
          Let <m>ab = ac</m> with <m>a \neq 0</m>.

      The following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every finite integral domain is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a finite integral domain and <m>D^\ast</m> be the set of nonzero elements of <m>D</m>.
          We must show that every element in <m>D^*</m> has an inverse.
          For each <m>a \in D^\ast</m> we can define a map
          <m>\lambda_a : D^\ast \rightarrow D^\ast</m> by <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad</m>.
          This map makes sense, because if  <m>a \neq 0</m> and
          <m>d \neq 0</m>, then <m>ad \neq 0</m>.
          The map <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one,
          since for <m>d_1, d_2 \in D^*</m>,
          <me>
            ad_1 = \lambda_a(d_1) = \lambda_a(d_2) = ad_2
          </me>
          implies <m>d_1 = d_2</m> by left cancellation.
          Since <m>D^\ast</m> is a finite set,
          the map <m>\lambda_a</m> must also be onto;
          hence, for some <m>d \in D^\ast</m>,
          <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad = 1</m>.
          Therefore, <m>a</m> has a left inverse.
          Since <m>D</m> is commutative,
          <m>d</m> must also be a right inverse for <m>a</m>.
          Consequently, <m>D</m> is a field.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Amalie Emmy Noether,
            <idx><h>Noether, A. Emmy</h></idx>
        one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century,
        was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882.
        She was the daughter of Max Noether
            <idx><h>Noether, Max</h></idx>
        (1844<ndash/>1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen.
        Together with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash/>1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education.
        She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18.
        Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France,
        and Italy for decades,
        there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany.
        Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students.
        After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907,
        she continued to do research at Erlangen,
        occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916.
        David Hilbert
            <idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
        and Felix Klein
            <idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
        tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen.
        Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying,
        <q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q> Hilbert,
        annoyed at the question, responded,
        <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent.
        After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q>
        At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women.
        After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919,
        she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen.
        Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals.
        Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher.
        One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden,
        author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view.
        Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin,
        von Neumann,
        and Weyl.
        One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932.
        In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime.
        She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1933, Noether, who was Jewish,
        was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany.
        She emigrated to the United States,
        took a position at Bryn Mawr College,
        and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
        Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935.
        After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.
