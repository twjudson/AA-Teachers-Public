  <title>Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Lagrange's Theorem,
      one of the most important results in finite group theory,
      states that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group.
      This theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing finite groups;
      it gives us an idea of exactly what type of subgroups we might expect a finite group to possess.
      Central to understanding Lagranges's Theorem is the notion of a coset.

    <p>
      Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      Define a <term>left coset</term>
          <idx><h>Coset</h><h>left</h></idx>
      of <m>H</m> with <term>representative</term><idx><h>Coset</h><h>representative</h></idx> <m>g \in G</m> to be the set
      <me>
        gH = \{ gh : h \in H \}
      </me>.
      <term>Right cosets</term>
          <idx><h>Coset</h><h>right</h></idx>
      can be defined similarly by
      <me>
        Hg = \{ hg : h \in H \}
      </me>.
      If left and right cosets coincide or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that we are referring,
      we will use the word <em>coset</em>
      without specifying left or right.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-cosets-z6-cosets">
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> consisting of the elements <m>0</m> and <m>3</m>.
        The cosets are
        <md>
          <mrow>0 + H = 3 + H = \{ 0, 3 \}</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + H = 4 + H = \{ 1, 4 \}</mrow>
          <mrow>2 + H = 5 + H = \{ 2, 5 \}</mrow>
        </md>.
        We will always write the cosets of subgroups of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> with the additive notation we have used for cosets here.
        In a commutative group, left and right cosets are always identical.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-cosets-s3-cosets">
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> defined by the permutations <m>\{(1), (123), (132) \}</m>.
        The left cosets of <m>H</m> are
        <md>
          <mrow>(1)H = (1 2 3)H =  (132)H = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \}</mrow>
          <mrow>(1 2)H = (1 3)H = (2 3)H =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}</mrow>
        </md>.
        The right cosets of <m>H</m> are exactly the same as the left cosets:
        <md>
          <mrow>H(1) = H(1 2 3) =  H(132) = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \}</mrow>
          <mrow>H(1 2) = H(1 3) = H(2 3) =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not always the case that a left coset is the same as a right coset.
        Let <m>K</m> be the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> defined by the permutations <m>\{(1), (1 2)\}</m>.
        Then the left cosets of <m>K</m> are
        <md>
          <mrow>(1)K = (1 2)K = \{(1), (1 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>(1 3)K = (1 2 3)K = \{(1 3), (1 2 3)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>(2 3)K = (1 3 2)K = \{(2 3), (1 3 2)\};</mrow>
        </md>
        however, the right cosets of <m>K</m> are
        <md>
          <mrow>K(1) = K(1 2) = \{(1), (1 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>K(1 3) = K(1 3 2) = \{(1 3), (1 3 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>K(2 3) = K(1 2 3) = \{(2 3), (1 2 3)\}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      The following lemma is quite useful when dealing with cosets.
      (We leave its proof as an exercise.)
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="lemma-cosets-theorem-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of a group <m>G</m> and suppose that <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>.
          The following conditions are equivalent.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>g_1 H = g_2 H</m>;

          </ol>

      </statement>
    </lemma>

    <p>
      In all of our examples the cosets of a subgroup <m>H</m> partition the larger group <m>G</m>.
      The following theorem proclaims that this will always be the case.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-cosets-theorem-2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>.
          Then the left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> partition <m>G</m>.
          That is, the group <m>G</m> is the disjoint union of the left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>g_1 H</m> and <m>g_2 H</m> be two cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
          We must show that either <m>g_1 H \cap g_2 H = \emptyset</m> or <m>g_1 H = g_2 H</m>.
          Suppose that <m>g_1 H \cap g_2 H \neq \emptyset</m> and <m>a \in g_1 H \cap g_2 H</m>.
          Then by the definition of a left coset,
          <m>a = g_1 h_1 = g_2 h_2</m> for some elements <m>h_1</m> and <m>h_2</m> in <m>H</m>.
          Hence, <m>g_1 = g_2 h_2 h_1^{-1}</m> or <m>g_1 \in g_2 H</m>.
          By <xref ref="lemma-cosets-theorem-1"/>, <m>g_1 H = g_2 H</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        There is nothing special in this theorem about left cosets.
        Right cosets also partition <m>G</m>;
        the proof of this fact is exactly the same as the proof for left cosets except that all group multiplications are done on the opposite side of <m>H</m>.

          If we can define a bijective map <m>\phi : {\mathcal L}_H \rightarrow {\mathcal R}_H</m>,
          then the theorem will be proved.
          If <m>gH \in {\mathcal L}_H</m>,
          let <m>\phi( gH ) = Hg^{-1}</m>.
          By <xref ref="lemma-cosets-theorem-1"/>, the map <m>\phi</m> is well-defined;
          that is, if <m>g_1 H = g_2 H</m>,
          then <m>H g_1^{-1} = H g_2^{-1}</m>.
          To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one, suppose that

            H g_1^{-1} = \phi( g_1 H ) = \phi( g_2 H ) = H g_2^{-1}

          Again by <xref ref="lemma-cosets-theorem-1"/>, <m>g_1 H = g_2 H</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          We first show that the map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one.
          Suppose that <m>\phi(h_1) = \phi(h_2)</m> for elements <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>.

        The group <m>A_4</m> has order <m>12</m>;
        however, it can be shown that it does not possess a subgroup of order <m>6</m>.
        According to Lagrange's Theorem,
        subgroups of a group of order <m>12</m> can have orders of either <m>1</m>,
        <m>2</m>,
        <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, or <m>6</m>.
        However, we are not guaranteed that subgroups of every possible order exist.
        To prove that <m>A_4</m> has no subgroup of order <m>6</m>,
        we will assume that it does have such a subgroup <m>H</m> and show that a contradiction must occur.
        Since <m>A_4</m> contains eight <m>3</m>-cycles,
        we know that <m>H</m> must contain a <m>3</m>-cycle.
        We will show that if <m>H</m> contains one <m>3</m>-cycle,

          Since <m>[A_4 : H] = 2</m>,
          there are only two cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>A_4</m>.
          Inasmuch as one of the cosets is <m>H</m> itself,

      In fact, we can say more about when two cycles have the same length.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Two cycles <m>\tau</m> and <m>\mu</m> in <m>S_n</m> have the same length if and only if there exists a
          <m>\sigma \in S_n</m> such that <m>\mu = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose that
          <md>
            <mrow>\tau &amp; = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k )</mrow>
            <mrow>\mu  &amp; = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k )</mrow>
          </md>.
          Define <m>\sigma</m> to be the permutation
          <md>
            <mrow>\sigma( a_1 ) &amp; = b_1</mrow>

          Then <m>\mu = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}</m>.

        <p>
          Conversely, suppose that <m>\tau = (a_1, a_2, \ldots,

          If <m>\sigma( a_i ) = b</m> and
          <m>\sigma( a_{(i \bmod k) + 1}) = b'</m>, then <m>\mu( b) = b'</m>.
          Hence,

            \mu = ( \sigma(a_1), \sigma(a_2), \ldots, \sigma(a_k) )

      <p>
        The <term>Euler</term> <m>\phi</m>-<term>function</term><idx><h>Euler <m>\phi</m>-function</h></idx> is the map <m>\phi : {\mathbb N } \rightarrow {\mathbb N}</m> defined by
        <m>\phi(n) = 1</m> for <m>n=1</m>, and, for <m>n \gt 1</m>,
        <m>\phi(n)</m> is the number of positive integers <m>m</m> with
        <m>1 \leq m \lt n</m> and <m>\gcd(m,n) = 1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <xref ref="proposition-zn-equiv-classes"/>, we know that the order of <m>U(n)</m>,
        the group of units in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>, is <m>\phi(n)</m>.
        For example,
        <m>|U(12)| = \phi(12) = 4</m> since the numbers that are relatively prime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11.
        For any prime <m>p</m>, <m>\phi(p) = p-1</m>.
        We state these results in the following theorem.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-cosets-theorem-11">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>U(n)</m> be the group of units in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.

        The following theorem is an important result in number theory,

          <p>
            By <xref ref="theorem-cosets-theorem-11"/> the order of <m>U(n)</m> is <m>\phi(n)</m>.
            Consequently, <m>a^{\phi(n)} = 1</m> for all <m>a \in U(n)</m>;
            or <m>a^{\phi(n)} - 1</m> is divisible by <m>n</m>.
            Therefore, <m>a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m>.

        If we consider the special case of Euler's Theorem in which <m>n = p</m> is prime and recall that <m>\phi(p) = p - 1</m>,

      <p>
        Joseph-Louis Lagrange
            <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
        (1736<ndash/>1813), born in Turin, Italy,
        was of French and Italian descent.
        His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age.
        Leonhard Euler
            <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
        recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19,
        communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations.
        That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin.
        At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy.
        Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the
        <q>greatest king in Europe</q>
        should have the <q>greatest mathematician in Europe</q> at his court.
        For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler.
        His works include contributions to number theory,
        group theory, physics and mechanics,
        the calculus of variations,
        the theory of equations, and differential equations.
        Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system.
        During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics,
        leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.
