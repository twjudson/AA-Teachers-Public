  <introduction>
    <p>
      We begin our study of algebraic structures by investigating sets associated with single operations that satisfy certain reasonable axioms;
      that is, we want to define an operation on a set in a way that will generalize such familiar structures as the integers
      <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> together with the single operation of addition,
      or invertible <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices together with the single operation of matrix multiplication.
      The integers and the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices,
      together with their respective single operations,
      are examples of algebraic structures known as groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      The theory of groups occupies a central position in mathematics.
      Modern group theory arose from an attempt to find the roots of a polynomial in terms of its coefficients.
      Groups now play a central role in such areas as coding theory,
      counting, and the study of symmetries;
      many areas of biology, chemistry,
      and physics have benefited from group theory.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let us now investigate some mathematical structures that can be viewed as sets with single operations.

      <title>The Integers mod <m>n</m></title>
      <p>
        The integers mod <m>n</m> have become indispensable in the theory and applications of algebra.
        In mathematics they are used in cryptography, coding theory,
        and the detection of errors in identification codes.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have already seen that two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are equivalent mod <m>n</m> if <m>n</m> divides <m>a - b</m>.
        The integers mod <m>n</m> also partition
        <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> into <m>n</m> different equivalence classes;
        we will denote the set of these equivalence classes by <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.

        <notation>
          <usage>\mathbb Z_n</usage>
          <description>the integers modulo <m>n</m></description>
        </notation>

        Consider the integers modulo <m>12</m> and the corresponding partition of the integers:
        <md>
          <mrow>{[0]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -12, 0, 12, 24, \ldots \},</mrow>
          <mrow>{[1]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -11, 1, 13, 25, \ldots \},</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \vdots</mrow>
          <mrow>{[11]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -1, 11, 23, 35, \ldots \}</mrow>
        </md>.
        When no confusion can arise,
        we will use <m>0, 1, \ldots, 11</m> to indicate the equivalence classes  <m>{[0]}, {[1]}, \ldots, {[11]}</m> respectively.
        We can do arithmetic on <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
        For two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        define addition modulo <m>n</m> to be <m>(a + b) \pmod{n}</m>;
        that is, the remainder when <m>a + b</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
        Similarly, multiplication modulo <m>n</m> is defined as <m>(a  b) \pmod{ n}</m>,
        the remainder when <m>a  b</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-groups-zn-addition">
        <p>
          The following examples illustrate integer arithmetic modulo <m>n</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>7 + 4 &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{ 5} &amp; 7 \cdot 3 &amp; \equiv 1 \pmod{ 5}</mrow>
            <mrow>3 + 5 &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{ 8} &amp; 3 \cdot 5 &amp; \equiv 7 \pmod{ 8}</mrow>
            <mrow>3 + 4 &amp; \equiv 7 \pmod{ 12} &amp; 3 \cdot 4 &amp; \equiv 0 \pmod{ 12}</mrow>
          </md>.
          In particular,
          notice that it is possible that the product of two nonzero numbers modulo <m>n</m> can be equivalent to <m>0</m> modulo <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-groups-zn-arithmetic-laws">
        <p>
          Most, but not all,
          of the usual laws of arithmetic hold for addition and multiplication in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
          For instance,
          it is not necessarily true that there is a multiplicative inverse.
          Consider the multiplication table for
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> in <xref ref="table-z8-mult"/>.
          Notice that <m>2</m>, <m>4</m>,
          and <m>6</m> do not have multiplicative inverses;
          that is, for <m>n = 2</m>, <m>4</m>, or <m>6</m>,
          there is no integer <m>k</m> such that <m>k n \equiv 1 \pmod{ 8}</m>.

            Let <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> be the set of equivalence classes of the integers mod <m>n</m> and <m>a,

                  There are both additive and multiplicative identities:

        <proof>
          <p>
            We will prove (1) and (6) and leave the remaining properties to be proven in the exercises.
          </p>

          <p>
            (1) Addition and multiplication are commutative modulo <m>n</m> since the remainder of <m>a + b</m> divided by <m>n</m> is the same as the remainder of <m>b + a</m> divided by <m>n</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            (6) Suppose that <m>\gcd(a, n) = 1</m>.
            Then there exist integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + ns = 1</m>.
            Since <m>ns = 1 - ar</m>,
            it must be the case that <m>ar \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m>.
            Letting <m>b</m> be the equivalence class of <m>r</m>,
            <m>a b \equiv 1\pmod{n}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, suppose that there exists an integer <m>b</m> such that <m>ab \equiv 1 \pmod{ n}</m>.
            Then <m>n</m> divides <m>ab -1</m>,
            so there is an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>ab - nk = 1</m>.
            Let <m>d = \gcd(a,n)</m>.
            Since <m>d</m> divides <m>ab - nk</m>,
            <m>d</m> must also divide <m>1</m>; hence, <m>d = 1</m>.

        A <term>symmetry</term> of a geometric figure is a rearrangement of the figure preserving the arrangement of its sides and vertices as well as its distances and angles.

        For example,
        if we look at the rectangle in <xref ref="figure-groups-rectangle"/>,
        it is easy to see that a rotation of <m>180^{\circ}</m> or

        A reflection of the rectangle across either the vertical axis or the horizontal axis can also be seen to be a symmetry.
        However, a <m>90^{\circ}</m> rotation in either direction cannot be a symmetry unless the rectangle is a square.

      <p>
        Let us find the symmetries of the equilateral triangle <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m>.
        To find a symmetry of <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m>,
        we must first examine the permutations of the vertices <m>A</m>,
        <m>B</m>,
        and <m>C</m> and then ask if a permutation extends to a symmetry of the triangle.
        Recall that a <term>permutation</term>
        of a set <m>S</m> is a one-to-one and onto map <m>\pi :S \rightarrow S</m>.
        The three vertices have <m>3! = 6</m> permutations,
        so the triangle has at most six symmetries.
        To see that there are six permutations,
        observe there are three different possibilities for the first vertex,
        and two for the second,
        and the remaining vertex is determined by the placement of the first two.
        So we have <m>3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 3! = 6</m> different arrangements.
        To denote the permutation of the vertices of an equilateral triangle that sends <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>,
        <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>, and <m>C</m> to <m>A</m>, we write the array
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
          A &amp; B &amp; C \\
          B &amp; C &amp; A
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>.
        Notice that this particular permutation corresponds to the rigid motion of rotating the triangle by
        <m>120^{\circ}</m> in a clockwise direction.
        In fact, every permutation gives rise to a symmetry of the triangle.
        All of these symmetries are shown in <xref ref="figure-s3-symmetry"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A natural question to ask is what happens if one motion of the triangle
        <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m> is followed by another.
        Which symmetry is <m>\mu_1 \rho_1</m>;
        that is, what happens when we do the permutation <m>\rho_1</m> and then the permutation <m>\mu_1</m>? 
        <em>Remember that we are composing functions here.
        Although we usually multiply left to right,
        we compose functions right to left.</em> We have
        <md>
          <mrow>(\mu_1 \rho_1)(A) &amp; = \mu_1( \rho_1( A ) ) = \mu_1( B ) = C</mrow>
          <mrow>(\mu_1 \rho_1)(B) &amp; = \mu_1( \rho_1( B ) ) = \mu_1( C ) = B</mrow>
          <mrow>(\mu_1 \rho_1)(C) &amp; = \mu_1( \rho_1( C ) ) = \mu_1( A ) = A</mrow>
        </md>.
        This is the same symmetry as <m>\mu_2</m>.
        Suppose we do these motions in the opposite order,
        <m>\rho_1</m> then <m>\mu_1</m>.
        It is easy to determine that this is the same as the symmetry <m>\mu_3</m>;
        hence, <m>\rho_1 \mu_1 \neq \mu_1 \rho_1</m>.
        A multiplication table for the symmetries of an equilateral triangle
        <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m> is given in <xref ref="table-s3"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that in the multiplication table for the symmetries of an equilateral triangle,
        for every motion of the triangle <m>\alpha</m> there is another motion <m>\beta</m> such that <m>\alpha \beta = \identity</m>;
        that is, for every motion there is another motion that takes the triangle back to its original orientation.

          The integers <m>{\mathbb Z } = \{ \ldots , -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}</m> form a group under the operation of addition.
          The binary operation on two integers <m>m,
          n \in {\mathbb Z}</m> is just their sum.
          Since the integers under addition already have a well-established notation,
          we will use the operator <m>+</m> instead of <m>\circ</m>;
          that is, we shall write <m>m + n</m> instead of <m>m \circ n</m>.
          The identity is <m>0</m>,
          and the inverse of <m>n \in {\mathbb Z}</m> is written as <m>-n</m> instead of <m>n^{-1}</m>.
          Notice that the set of integers under addition have the additional property that
          <m>m + n = n + m</m> and therefore form an abelian group.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        Most of the time we will write <m>ab</m> instead of <m>a \circ b</m>;
        however, if the group already has a natural operation such as addition in the integers,
        we will use that operation.
        That is, if we are adding two integers,
        we still write <m>m + n</m>,
        <m>-n</m> for the inverse, and 0 for the identity as usual.
        We also write <m>m - n</m> instead of <m>m + (-n)</m>.

          Not every set with a binary operation is a group.

          if we let modular multiplication be the binary operation on <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
          then <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> fails to be a group.
          The element 1 acts as a group identity since

          Even if we consider the set <m>{\mathbb Z}_n \setminus \{0 \}</m>,

        does there exist an element <m>x \in G</m> such that <m>ax = b</m>?

            In a group, the usual laws of exponents hold;

        We will leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise.
        Notice that <m>(gh)^n \neq g^nh^n</m> in general,
        since the group may not be abelian.
        If the group is <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
        we write the group operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively;
        that is, we write <m>ng</m> instead of <m>g^n</m>.
        The laws of exponents now become

        Although the first clear axiomatic definition of a group was not given until the late 1800s,
        group-theoretic methods had been employed before this time in the development of many areas of mathematics,
        including geometry and the theory of algebraic equations.

      <p>
        Joseph-Louis Lagrange
            <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
        used group-theoretic methods in a 1770<ndash/>1771 memoir to study methods of solving polynomial equations.
        Later, Évariste Galois
            <idx><h>Galois, Évariste</h></idx>
        (1811<ndash/>1832) succeeded in developing the mathematics necessary to determine exactly which polynomial equations could be solved in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial.
        Galois' primary tool was group theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein
            <idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
        proposed that geometric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under a transformation of the space.
        Sophus Lie,

        a contemporary of Klein,
        used group theory to study solutions of partial differential equations.

        Sometimes we wish to investigate smaller groups sitting inside a larger group.
        The set of even integers <m>2{\mathbb Z} = \{\ldots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \}</m> is a group under the operation of addition.
        This smaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition.
        We define a <term>subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup</h><h>definition of</h></idx> <m>H</m> of a group <m>G</m> to be a subset <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> such that when the group operation of <m>G</m> is restricted to <m>H</m>,
        <m>H</m> is a group in its own right.
        Observe that every group <m>G</m> with at least two elements will always have at least two subgroups,
        the subgroup consisting of the identity element alone and the entire group itself.
        The subgroup <m>H = \{ e \}</m> of a group <m>G</m> is called the
        <term>trivial subgroup</term>.

        In many of the examples that we have investigated up to this point,

          The inverse of any element <m>p/q \in {\mathbb Q}^*</m> is again in
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^*</m> since <m>(p/q)^{-1} = q/p</m>.

            A subset <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The identity <m>e</m> of <m>G</m> is in <m>H</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>, then <m>h_1h_2 \in H</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>h \in H</m>, then <m>h^{-1} \in H</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
            We must show that the three conditions hold.
            Since <m>H</m> is a group, it must have an identity <m>e_H</m>.
            We must show that <m>e_H = e</m>,
            where <m>e</m> is the identity of <m>G</m>.
            We know that <m>e_H e_H = e_H</m> and that <m>ee_H = e_H e = e_H</m>;
            hence, <m>ee_H = e_H e_H</m>.
            By right-hand cancellation, <m>e =e_H</m>.
            The second condition holds since a subgroup <m>H</m> is a group.
            To prove the third condition, let <m>h \in H</m>.
            Since <m>H</m> is a group,
            there is an element <m>h' \in H</m> such that <m>hh' = h'h = e</m>.
            By the uniqueness of the inverse in <m>G</m>, <m>h' = h^{-1}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, if the three conditions hold,
            we must show that <m>H</m> is a group under the same operation as <m>G</m>;
            however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are exactly the axioms stated in the definition of a group.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>H</m> be a subset of a group <m>G</m>.
            Then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> if and only if <m>H \neq \emptyset</m>,
            and whenever <m>g, h \in H</m> then <m>gh^{-1}</m> is in <m>H</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            First assume that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
            We wish to show that <m>gh^{-1} \in H</m> whenever <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are in <m>H</m>.
            Since <m>h</m> is in <m>H</m>,
            its inverse <m>h^{-1}</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
            Because of the closure of the group operation, <m>gh^{-1} \in H</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, suppose that <m>H \subset G</m> such that <m>H \neq \emptyset</m> and
            <m>g h^{-1} \in H</m> whenever <m>g, h \in H</m>.
            If <m>g \in H</m>, then <m>gg^{-1} = e</m> is in <m>H</m>.
            If <m>g \in H</m>, then <m>eg^{-1} = g^{-1}</m> is also in <m>H</m>.
            Now let <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>.
            We must show that their product is also in <m>H</m>.
            However, <m>h_1(h_2^{-1})^{-1} = h_1 h_2 \in H</m>.
            Hence, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

If <m>g \in H</m>, then <m>eg^{-1} = g^{-1}</m> is also in <m>H</m>. Finally, let <m>g, h \in H</m>. We must show that their product is also in <m>H</m>.  However, <m>g(h^{-1})^{-1} = gh \in H</m>.

          The first half of this text is about group theory.
          Sage includes Groups, Algorithms and Programming (<acro>GAP</acro>),
          a program designed primarly for just group theory,
          and in continuous development since 1986.
          Many of Sage's computations for groups ultimately are performed by GAP.

                What about all transposition errors?

                A publisher has houses in Germany and the United States.
                Its German prefix is 3-540.
                If its United States prefix will be 0-<c>abc</c>,
                find <c>abc</c> such that the rest of the <acro>ISBN</acro> code will be the same for a book printed in Germany and in the United States.
                Under the <acro>ISBN</acro> coding method the first digit identifies the language; German is 3 and English is 0.
                The next group of numbers identifies the publisher,
                and the last group identifies the specific book.
