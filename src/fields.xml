  <title>Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is natural to ask whether or not some field <m>F</m> is contained in a larger field.
      We think of the rational numbers,
      which reside inside the real numbers,
      while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.
      We can also study the fields between <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and
      <m>{\mathbb R}</m> and inquire as to the nature of these fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      we can ask whether or not we can find a field <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over <m>E[x]</m>.
      For example, if we consider the polynomial
      <me>
        p(x) = x^4 -5 x^2 + 6
      </me>
      in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,
      then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>.
      However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
      If we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>,
      we must go to a larger field.
      Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
      <me>
        p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3})
      </me>.
      It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero, namely
      <me>
        {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
      </me>.
      We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field <m>F</m>.

    <title>Extension Fields</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term>
            <idx><h>Extension</h><h>field</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Field</h><h>extension</h></idx>
        of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
        The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.
            <idx><h>Field</h><h>base</h></idx>
        We write <m>F \subset E</m>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-fields-q-sqrt2">
        <p>
          For example, let
          <me>
            F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
          </me>
          and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
          Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are extension fields of the rational numbers.
          We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          To see this,
          we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>,
          <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>.
          Taking linear combinations of
          <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>,
          we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
          <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f4">
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
          Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
          we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
          We will construct a field extension of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          By <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>,
          the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
          hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          By the division algorithm,
          <me>
            f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
          </me>,
          where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
          Therefore,
          <me>
            f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
          </me>.
          The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
          <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
          Consequently,
          <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
          containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
          The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
          <md>
            <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
          </md>.
          Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
          hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
          <me>
            (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha
          </me>.
          Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
          We summarize these computations in the following tables,
          which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

        The following theorem, due to Kronecker,
        is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
            Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an element
            <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            To prove this theorem,
            we will employ the method that we used to construct <xref ref="example-fields-finite-f4"/>.
            Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial.
            We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
            The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>;
            hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
            We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
          </p>

          <p>
            We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
            We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
            where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
            It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
            Observe that
            <me>
              \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
            </me>
            and
            <me>
              \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
            </me>.
            To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
            <me>
              a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
            </me>.
            Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
            since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
            the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
            Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
            Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
            we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
            <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          </p>
            <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
          <p>
            It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
            Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
            If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
            <md>
              <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
            </md>.
            Therefore, we have found an element
            <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f8">
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x) = x^5 + x^4 + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
          Then <m>p(x)</m> has irreducible factors
          <m>x^2 + x + 1</m> and <m>x^3 + x + 1</m>.
          For a field extension <m>E</m> of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> has a root in <m>E</m>,
          we can let <m>E</m> be either
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m>.
          We will leave it as an exercise to show that
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with <m>2^3 = 8</m> elements.

            This is true if and only if <m>\ker \phi_{\alpha} = \{ 0 \}</m>;
            that is, it is true exactly when <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is one-to-one.
            Hence, <m>E</m> must contain a copy of <m>F[x]</m>.
            The smallest field containing <m>F[x]</m> is the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism.
            The kernel of <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is a principal ideal generated by some
            <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>\deg p(x) \geq 1</m>.
            We know that such a polynomial exists,
            since <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain and <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic.
            The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
            If <m>f( \alpha ) = 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial,
            then <m>f(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> and <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
            So <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
            Any other polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the form
            <m>\beta p( x)</m> for some <m>\beta \in F</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose now that <m>p(x) = r(x) s(x)</m> is a factorization of <m>p(x)</m> into polynomials of lower degree.
            Since <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>,
            <m>r( \alpha ) s( \alpha ) = 0</m>;
            consequently,
            either <m>r( \alpha )=0</m> or <m>s( \alpha ) = 0</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>p</m> is of minimal degree.
            Therefore, <m>p(x)</m> must be irreducible.

            Then <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>; hence,

            is in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>g( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
            Since the degree of <m>g(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>p( x )</m>,
            the irreducible polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>,
            <m>g(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial.

          <p>
            Let <m>\{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \}</m> be a basis for <m>E</m> as a vector space over <m>F</m> and

            We claim that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> is a basis for <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.
            We will first show that these vectors span <m>K</m>.
            Let <m>u \in K</m>.
            Then <m>u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_j \beta_j</m> and <m>b_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i</m>,

            Then

              u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i  \right) \beta_j = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j )

          <p>
            We must show that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> are linearly independent.
            Recall that a set of vectors

              c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0

            implies that
            <me>
              c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0
            </me>.
            Let
            <me>
              u = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j ) = 0
            </me>
            for <m>c_{ij} \in F</m>.
            We need to prove that all of the <m>c_{ij}</m>'s are zero.
            We can rewrite <m>u</m> as
            <me>
              \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ij} \alpha_i \right) \beta_j = 0
            </me>,
            where <m>\sum_i c_{ij} \alpha_i \in E</m>.
            Since the <m>\beta_j</m>'s are linearly independent over <m>E</m>,
            it must be the case that
            <me>

          Let us determine an extension field of

          It is easy to determine that the minimal  polynomial of
          <m>\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}</m> is <m>x^4 - 16 x^2 + 4</m>.
          It follows that
          <me>
            [{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\, ) : {\mathbb Q} ] = 4
          </me>.
          We know that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}\, \}</m> is a basis for 
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          Hence, <m>\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}</m> cannot be in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m>.
          It follows that <m>\sqrt{5}</m> cannot be in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> either.
          Therefore, <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{5}\, \}</m> is a basis for <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) = ( {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}\, ))( \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> and <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{3} \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{15}\, \}</m> is a basis for
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          This example shows that it is possible that some extension

          It is easy to determine that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{5}i\, \}</m> is a basis for

          </me>.
          Notice that <m>\sqrt[6]{5}\, i</m> is a zero of <m>x^6 + 5</m>.
          We can show that this polynomial is irreducible over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> using Eisenstein's Criterion,

          Consequently,

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory.
        Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat
            <idx><h>Fermat, Pierre de</h></idx>
        (1601<ndash/>1665).
        Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation
        <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation
        <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> has no positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.
        He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <pubtitle>Arithmetica</pubtitle> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem,
        but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.
        Building on work of other mathematicians,
        it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s.
        Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <pubtitle>New York Times</pubtitle>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler
            <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
        (1707<ndash/>1783).
        Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer
            <idx><h>Kummer, Ernst</h></idx>
        (1810<ndash/>1893).
        Kummer's student, Leopold Kronecker
            <idx><h>Kronecker, Leopold</h></idx>
        (1823<ndash/>1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century.
        Kronecker's theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.

        David Hilbert
            <idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>

            <idx><h>Minkowski, Hermann</h></idx>
        (1864<ndash/>1909) were among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century.
        Hilbert and Minkowski were both mathematicians at Göttingen University in Germany.
        Göttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two centuries.
        The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether,
