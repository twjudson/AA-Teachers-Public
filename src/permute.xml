  <title>Permutation Groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Permutation groups are central to the study of geometric symmetries and to Galois theory,
      the study of finding solutions of polynomial equations.
      They also provide abundant examples of nonabelian groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us recall for a moment the symmetries of the equilateral triangle
      <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m> from <xref ref="groups"/>.
      The symmetries actually consist of permutations of the three vertices,
      where a <term>permutation</term><idx><h>Permutation</h><h>definition of</h></idx> of the set
      <m>S = \{ A, B, C \}</m> is a one-to-one and onto map <m>\pi :S \rightarrow S</m>.
      The three vertices have the following six permutations.

      <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>, and <m>C</m> to <m>A</m>.

      The symmetries of a triangle form a group.
      In this chapter we will study groups of this type.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In general, the permutations of a set <m>X</m> form a group <m>S_X</m>.
        If <m>X</m> is a finite set, we can assume <m>X=\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\}</m>.
        In this case we write <m>S_n</m> instead of <m>S_X</m>.

        <notation>
          <usage>S_n</usage>
          <description>the symmetric group on <m>n</m> letters</description>
        </notation>

        The following theorem says that <m>S_n</m> is a group.
        We call this group the <term>symmetric group</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>symmetric</h></idx>
        on <m>n</m> letters.
      </p>

      <theorem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The symmetric group on <m>n</m> letters, <m>S_n</m>,
            is a group with <m>n!</m> elements,
            where the binary operation is the composition of maps.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            The identity of <m>S_n</m> is just the identity map that sends <m>1</m> to <m>1</m>,
            <m>2</m> to <m>2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>n</m> to <m>n</m>.
            If <m>f : S_n \rightarrow S_n</m> is a permutation,
            then <m>f^{-1}</m> exists, since <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto;
            hence, every permutation has an inverse.
            Composition of maps is associative,
            which makes the group operation associative.
            We leave the proof that <m>|S_n|= n!</m> as an exercise.
          </p>
        </proof>

        A subgroup of <m>S_n</m> is called a

      <remark>
        <p>
          Though it is natural to multiply elements in a group from left to right,
          functions are composed from right to left.
          Let <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> be permutations on a set <m>X</m>.
          To compose <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> as functions,
          we calculate <m>(\sigma \circ \tau)(x) = \sigma( \tau(x))</m>.
          That is, we do <m>\tau</m> first, then <m>\sigma</m>.
          There are several ways to approach this inconsistency.
          <em>We will adopt the convention of multiplying permutations right to left.
          To compute <m>\sigma \tau</m>,
          do <m>\tau</m> first and then <m>\sigma</m>.</em> That is,
          by <m>\sigma \tau (x)</m> we mean
          <m>\sigma( \tau( x))</m>. (Another way of solving this problem would be to write functions on the right;
          that is, instead of writing <m>\sigma(x)</m>,
          we could write <m>(x)\sigma</m>.
          We could also multiply permutations left to right to agree with the usual way of multiplying elements in a group.
          Certainly all of these methods have been used.

        The notation that we have used to represent permutations up to this point is cumbersome,
        to say the least.
        To work effectively with permutation groups,
        we need a more streamlined method of writing down and manipulating permutations.

      <theorem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Every permutation in <m>S_n</m> can be written as the product of disjoint cycles.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We can assume that <m>X = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}</m>.
            If <m>\sigma \in S_n</m> and we define <m>X_1</m> to be <m>\{ \sigma(1), \sigma^2(1), \ldots \}</m>,
            then the set <m>X_1</m> is finite since <m>X</m> is finite.
            Now let <m>i</m> be the first integer in <m>X</m> that is not in <m>X_1</m> and define <m>X_2</m> by <m>\{ \sigma(i), \sigma^2(i), \ldots \}</m>.
            Again, <m>X_2</m> is a finite set.
            Continuing in this manner,
            we can define finite disjoint sets <m>X_3, X_4, \ldots</m>.
            Since <m>X</m> is a finite set,
            we are guaranteed that this process will end and there will be only a finite number of these sets,
            say <m>r</m>.
            If <m>\sigma_i</m> is the cycle defined by
            <me>
              \sigma_i( x ) = 
              \begin{cases}
              \sigma( x ) &amp; x \in X_i \\
              x   &amp; x \notin X_i
              \end{cases}
            </me>,
            then <m>\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_r</m>.
            Since the sets <m>X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_r</m> are disjoint,
            the cycles <m>\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_r</m> must also be disjoint.

    <subsection xml:id="permute-subsection-transpositions">
      <title>Transpositions</title>
      <p>
        The simplest permutation is a cycle of length <m>2</m>.
        Such cycles are called <term>transpositions</term>.
            <idx><h>Transposition</h></idx>
        Since
        <me>
          (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n ) = (a_1 a_n ) (a_1 a_{n-1} ) \cdots ( a_1 a_3 ) (a_1 a_2 )
        </me>,
        any cycle can be written as the product of transpositions,
        leading to the following proposition.
      </p>

      <proposition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Any permutation of a finite set containing at least two elements can be written as the product of transpositions.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </proposition>

      <example xml:id="example-permute-transpositions">
        <p>
          Consider the permutation
          <me>
            ( 1 6 ) (2 5 3) = (1 6 )( 2 3 )( 2 5 ) = (1 6 )( 4 5 )(2 3 )( 4 5 )(2 5 )
          </me>.
          As we can see,
          there is no unique way to represent permutation as the product of transpositions.
          For instance,
          we can write the identity permutation as <m>(1 2 )(1 2 )</m>,
          as <m>(1 3 )(2 4 )(1 3 )( 2 4 )</m>, and in many other ways.
          However, as it turns out,
          no permutation can be written as the product of both an even number of transpositions and an odd number of transpositions.
          For instance, we could represent the permutation <m>(1 6)</m> by
          <me>
            (2 3 )(1 6)( 2 3)
          </me>
          or by
          <me>
            (3 5) (1 6) (1 3) (1 6) (1 3) (3 5) (5 6)
          </me>,
          but <m>(1 6)</m> will always be the product of an odd number of transpositions.
        </p>
      </example>

      <lemma xml:id="lemma-identity-even-trans">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If the identity is written as the product of <m>r</m> transpositions,
            <me>
              \identity = \tau_1 \tau_2 \cdots \tau_r
            </me>,
            then <m>r</m> is an even number.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We will employ induction  on <m>r</m>.
            A transposition cannot be the identity;
            hence, <m>r \gt 1</m>.
            If <m>r=2</m>, then we are done.
            Suppose that <m>r \gt 2</m>.
            In this case the product of the last two transpositions,
            <m>\tau_{r-1} \tau_r</m>, must be one of the following cases:
            <md>
              <mrow>(a b)(a b) &amp; = \identity</mrow>
              <mrow>(b c)(a b) &amp; = (a c)(b c)</mrow>
              <mrow>(c d)(a b) &amp; = (a b)(c d)</mrow>
              <mrow>(a c)(a b) &amp; = (a b)(b c)</mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>,
            and <m>d</m> are distinct.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first equation simply says that a transposition is its own inverse.
            If this case occurs, delete
            <m>\tau_{r-1} \tau_r</m> from the product to obtain
            <me>
              \identity = \tau_1 \tau_2 \cdots \tau_{r - 3} \tau_{r - 2}
            </me>.
            By induction <m>r - 2</m> is even;
            hence, <m>r</m> must be even.
          </p>

          <p>
            In each of the other three cases,
            we can replace <m>\tau_{r - 1} \tau_r</m> with the right-hand side of the corresponding equation to obtain a new product of <m>r</m> transpositions for the identity.
            In this new product the last occurrence of <m>a</m> will be in the next-to-the-last transposition.
            We can continue this process with
            <m>\tau_{r - 2} \tau_{r - 1}</m> to obtain either a product of <m>r - 2</m> transpositions or a new product of <m>r</m> transpositions where the last occurrence of <m>a</m> is in <m>\tau_{r - 2}</m>.
            If the identity is the product of <m>r - 2</m> transpositions,
            then again we are done, by our induction hypothesis;
            otherwise, we will repeat the procedure with <m>\tau_{r - 3} \tau_{r - 2}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point either we will have two adjacent,
            identical transpositions canceling each other out or <m>a</m> will be shuffled so that it will appear only in the first transposition.
            However, the latter case cannot occur,
            because the identity would not fix <m>a</m> in this instance.
            Therefore, the identity permutation must be the product of <m>r-2</m> transpositions and,
            again by our induction hypothesis, we are done.

        Another special type of permutation group is the dihedral group.
        Recall the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle in <xref ref="groups"/>.
        Such groups consist of the rigid motions of a regular <m>n</m>-sided polygon or <m>n</m>-gon.
        For <m>n = 3, 4, \ldots</m>, we define the
        <term>nth dihedral group</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>dihedral</h></idx>
        to be the group of rigid motions of a regular <m>n</m>-gon.
        We will denote this group by <m>D_n</m>.

        <notation>
          <usage>D_n</usage>
          <description>the dihedral group</description>

        We can number the vertices of a regular <m>n</m>-gon by
        <m>1, 2, \ldots,
        n</m> (<xref ref="figure-regular"/>).
        Notice that there are exactly <m>n</m> choices to replace the first vertex.
        If we replace the first vertex by <m>k</m>,
        then the second vertex must be replaced either by vertex <m>k+1</m> or by vertex <m>k-1</m>;
        hence, there are <m>2n</m> possible rigid motions of the <m>n</m>-gon.
        We summarize these results in the following theorem.

        <proof>
          <p>
            The possible motions of a regular <m>n</m>-gon are either reflections or rotations (<xref ref="figure-rotations"/>).
            There are exactly <m>n</m> possible rotations:
            <me>
              \identity, \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}, 2 \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}, \ldots, (n-1) \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}
            </me>.
            We will denote the rotation <m>360^{\circ} /n</m> by <m>r</m>.
            The rotation <m>r</m> generates all  of the other rotations.
            That is,
            <me>
              r^k = k \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}
            </me>.

            Label the <m>n</m> reflections <m>s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n</m>,
            where <m>s_k</m> is the reflection that leaves vertex <m>k</m> fixed.
            There are two cases of reflections,
            depending on whether <m>n</m> is even or odd.
            If there are an even number of vertices,
            then two vertices are left fixed by a reflection,
            and <m>s_1 = s_{n/2 + 1}, s_2 = s_{n/2 + 2}, \ldots, s_{n/2}  = s_n</m>.
            If there are an odd number of vertices,
            then only a single vertex is left fixed by a reflection and
            <m>s_1, s_2, \ldots,
            s_n</m> are distinct (<xref ref="figure-types"/>).
            In either case, the order of each <m>s_k</m> is two.
            Let <m>s = s_1</m>.
            Then <m>s^2 = 1</m> and <m>r^n = 1</m>.
            Since any rigid motion <m>t</m> of the <m>n</m>-gon replaces the first vertex by the vertex <m>k</m>,
            the second vertex must be replaced by either <m>k+1</m> or by <m>k-1</m>.
            If the second vertex is replaced by <m>k+1</m>, then <m>t = r^k</m>.
            If the second vertex is replaced by <m>k-1</m>, then <m>t = s r^k</m>.
            Hence, <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> generate <m>D_n</m>.
            That is, <m>D_n</m> consists of all finite products of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>,
            <me>
              D_n = \{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n-1}, s, sr, sr^2, \ldots, sr^{n-1}\}

            We will leave the proof that <m>srs = r^{-1}</m> as an exercise.

      <title>The Motion Group of a Cube</title>
      <p>
        We can investigate the groups of rigid motions of geometric objects other than a regular <m>n</m>-sided polygon to obtain interesting examples of permutation groups.
        Let us consider the group of rigid motions of a cube.
        One of the first questions that we can ask about this group is
        <q>what is its order?</q>
        A cube has <m>6</m> sides.
        If a particular side is facing upward,
        then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-facing side.
        Hence, the order of the group is <m>6 \cdot 4 = 24</m>.
        We have just proved the following proposition.
      </p>



      <proposition xml:id="proposition-motions-cube">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The group of rigid motions of a cube contains <m>24</m> elements.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </proposition>

      <theorem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The group of rigid motions of a cube is <m>S_4</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            From <xref ref="proposition-motions-cube"/>,
            we already know that the motion group of the cube has <m>24</m> elements,
            the same number of elements as there are in <m>S_4</m>.
            There are exactly four diagonals in the cube.
            If we label these diagonals <m>1</m>,
            <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, and <m>4</m>,
            we must show that the motion group of the cube will give us any permutation of the diagonals (<xref ref="figure-motions"/>).
            If we can obtain all of these permutations,
            then <m>S_4</m> and the group of rigid motions of the cube must be the same.
            To obtain a transposition we can rotate the cube
            <m>180^{\circ}</m> about the axis joining the midpoints of opposite edges (<xref ref="figure-transpose"/>).
            There are six such axes, giving all transpositions in <m>S_4</m>.
            Since every element in <m>S_4</m> is the product of a finite number of transpositions,
            the motion group of a cube must be <m>S_4</m>.
          </p>
